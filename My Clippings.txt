The failure was not due to insufficient data, but instead how analysts used that data to form a prediction. Ratings agencies based their prediction on multiple regression–like models that assumed house prices in different markets were not correlated with one another. That turned out to be false, not just in 2007 but also previously. Include the possibility that a shock might hit many housing markets simultaneously, and the probability goes way up that you lose out on CDOs, even if they are distributed across many US cities. Analysts built their regression models on hypotheses of what they believed mattered and how—beliefs unnecessary for machine learning. Machine learning models are particularly good at determining which of many possible variables will work best and recognizing that some things don’t matter and others, perhaps surprisingly, do. Now, an analyst’s intuition and hypotheses are less important. In this way, machine learning enables predictions based on unanticipated correlations, including that housing prices in Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Miami might move together.

But the potential power of such products comes from combining this rich data with a prediction machine. Both academic and industry researchers have shown that smartphones can predict irregular heart rhythms (medically, atrial fibrillation).2 So, with their prediction machines, the products that Cardiogram, AliveCor, Cardiio, and others are building use heart rate data to help diagnose heart disease. The general approach is to use heart rate data to predict the unknown information of whether a particular user has an abnormal heart rhythm. This input data is necessary to operate the prediction machine. Because prediction machines cannot run without input data, we often label it simply “data,” in contrast to training and feedback data. The uninitiated consumer cannot see the link between heart rate data and an abnormal heart rhythm from raw data. In contrast, Cardiogram can detect an irregular heart rhythm with 97 percent accuracy using its deep neural network.3 Such abnormalities cause about a quarter of strokes. With better prediction, doctors can deliver better treatment. Certain drugs can prevent strokes. For this to work, individual consumers have to provide their heart rate data. Without personal data, a machine cannot predict the risk for that particular person. The combination of a prediction machine with an individual’s personal data enables a prediction for that person’s likelihood of an irregular heart rhythm.

However, acquiring training data can be challenging. To predict the same group of items (in this case, heart patients), you need information on the outcome of interest (irregular heart rhythms) as well as information on something that will be useful for predicting that outcome in a new context (cardio-monitoring).

In order to make a good prediction, the machine must have enough individuals (or units of analysis) in the training data. The number of individuals required depends on two factors: first, how reliable the “signal” is relative to the “noise,” and second, how accurate the prediction must be to be useful. In other words, the number of required people depends on whether we expect heart rates to be a strong or a weak predictor of irregular heart rhythms and how costly a mistake will be. If heart rate is a strong predictor and mistakes are not a big deal, then we only need a few people. If heart rate is a weak predictor or if each mistake puts lives at risk, then we need thousands or even millions. Cardiogram, in its preliminary study, used six thousand people, including just two hundred with an irregular heart rhythm. Over time, one way to collect further data is through feedback on whether the app’s users have or develop irregular heart rhythms.

So, while the data technically has decreasing returns to scale—the billionth search is less useful for improving the search engine than the first—from a business viewpoint, data might be most valuable if you have more and better data than your competitor. Some have argued that more data about unique factors brings disproportionate rewards in the market.6 Increasing data brings disproportionate rewards in the market. Thus, from an economic point of view, in such cases data may have increasing returns to scale.

The answer—demonstrated over many experiments by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky—is decidedly yes.2 When they told people to consider two hospitals—one with forty-five births per day and another with fifteen births per day—and asked which hospital would have more days when 60 percent or more of the babies born are boys, very few gave the correct answer—the smaller hospital. The smaller hospital is correct because the larger the number of events (in this case, births), the likelier each daily outcome will be close to the average (in this case, 50 percent). To see how this works, imagine you are flipping coins. You are more likely to get heads every time if you flip five coins than if you flip fifty coins. Thus, the smaller hospital—precisely because it has fewer births—is more likely to have more extreme outcomes away from the average.

As we describe above, in the case of known unknowns, humans understand the inaccuracy of the prediction. The prediction comes with a confidence range that reveals its imprecision. In the case of unknown unknowns, humans don’t think they have any answers. In contrast, with unknown knowns, prediction machines appear to provide a very precise answer, but that answer can be very wrong.

No. To figure out if reading this book had an impact, you also need to know what would have happened if you hadn’t read this book. You don’t have that data. You need to observe what economists and statisticians call the “counterfactual”: what would have happened if you took a different action. Determining whether an action causes an outcome requires two predictions: first, what outcome will happen after the action is taken, and second, what outcome would have happened had a different action been taken. But that’s impossible. You will never have data on the action not taken.16

But a prediction is not a decision. Making a decision requires applying judgment to a prediction and then acting. Before recent advances in machine intelligence, this distinction was only of academic interest because humans always performed prediction and judgment together.

Gibson Greeting Cards Inc., which published greeting cards and owned the rights to the Garfield the Cat cartoon character, was an unloved subsidiary of RCA Corporation, the parent of the NBC television network, when a buyout shop called Wesray bought it in January 1982. Wesray, which was cofounded by former Nixon and Ford treasury secretary William E. Simon, paid $80 million, but Wesray and the card company’s management put up just $1 million of that and borrowed the rest. With so little equity, they didn’t have much to lose if the company failed but stood to make many times their money if they sold out at a higher price. Sixteen months later, after selling off Gibson Greeting’s real estate, Wesray and the management took the company public in a stock offering that valued it at $290 million. Without leverage (another term for debt), they would have made roughly three and a half times their money. But with the extraordinary ratio of debt in the original deal, Simon and his Wesray partner Raymond Chambers each made more than $65 million on their respective $330,000 investments—a two-hundred-fold profit. Their phenomenal gain instantly became legend. Weeks after, New York magazine and the New York Times were still dissecting Wesray’s coup.

At Lehman, Steve Schwarzman looked on at the Gibson IPO in rapt amazement like everyone else. He couldn’t help but pay attention, because he had been RCA’s banker and adviser when it sold Gibson to Wesray in the first place and had told RCA the price was too cheap. The Houdaille and Gibson deals would mark the beginning of his lasting fascination with leveraged buyouts.

By the 1980s, though, Lehman had regained financial strength and Peterson and Schwarzman began to press the rest of management to consider merchant banking again. They even went so far as to line up a target, Stewart-Warner Corporation, a publicly traded maker of speedometers based in Chicago. They proposed that Lehman lead a leveraged buyout of the company, but Lehman’s executive committee, which Peterson chaired but didn’t control, shot down the plan. Some members worried that clients might view Lehman as a competitor if it started buying companies. “It was a fairly ludicrous argument,” Peterson says. “I couldn’t believe they turned this down,” says Schwarzman. “There was more money to be made in a deal like that than there was in a whole year of earnings for Lehman”—about $200 million at the time. The two never gave up on the dream. Schwarzman would invite Dick Beattie, the lawyer for the Kohlberg Kravis buyout firm whose law firm was also Lehman’s primary outside counsel, to speak to Lehman bankers about the mechanics of buyouts. “Lurking in the background was the question, ‘Why can’t Lehman get into this?’ ” Beattie recalls. All around them, banks like Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch were launching their own merchant banking divisions. For the time being, however, Peterson and Schwarzman would watch from the sidelines as the LBO wave set off by Houdaille and Gibson Greeting gathered force. They would have to be content plying their trade as M&A bankers, advising companies rather than leading their own investments.

The trader was the one who understood why Lehman had bought the securities and what went wrong. “I argued that the guy who created the mess in the first place was in the best position to fix it,” Hellman says. Peterson concurred, believing, he says, that “everyone is entitled to one big mistake.” Glucksman made good on his second chance and, under Peterson, Lehman rebounded. In 1975 BusinessWeek put Peterson’s granite-jawed visage on its cover and heralded his achievement with the headline “Back from the Brink Comes Lehman Bros.” Despite his role in righting the firm, Peterson never fit easily into Lehman’s

to remind him to attend some charity ball or to call a CEO the next morning. The off-in-the clouds quality carried over into his years at Blackstone, too. Howard Lipson, a longtime Blackstone partner, remembers seeing Peterson one blustery night sporting a bulky winter hat. Affixed to its crown was a note: “Pete—don’t forget your hat.” Lipson recalls, too, the terror and helplessness Peterson would express when his secretary stepped away and he was faced with having to answer his own phone. “Patty! Patty!” he’d yowl. Peterson enjoyed the attention and ribbing that his absentmindedness provoked from others. In his conference room, he would later showcase a plaque from the Council on Foreign Relations given out of appreciation for, among other things, “his unending search for his briefcase.” “This was endearing stuff,” says Lipson. “Some people said he was losing it, but Pete wasn’t that old. I think it was a sign he had many things going on in his mind.” David Batten, a Blackstone partner in the early 1990s who admires Peterson, has the same take: “Pete was probably thinking great thoughts,” he says, alluding to the fact that Peterson often was preoccupied with big-picture policy issues. During his Lehman years, he was a trustee of the Brookings Institution, a well-known think tank, and occasionally served on ad hoc government advisory committees. Later, at Blackstone, he authored several essays and books on U.S. fiscal policy. If he sometimes seemed oblivious to underlings, he was assiduous in cultivating celebrities in the media, the arts, and government—Barbara Walters, David Rockefeller, Henry Kissinger, Mike Nichols, and Diane Sawyer, among others—and was relentless in his name-dropping. Far outweighing his shortcomings was his feat of managing Lehman through a decade of prosperity. This was no small achievement at an institution racked by vicious rivalries. Since the death in 1969 of its longtime dominant leader, Bobbie Lehman, who’d kept a lid on internal clashes, Lehman had devolved into a snake pit. Partners plotted to one-up each other and to capture more bonus money. One Lehman partner was rumored to have coaxed another into selling him his stock in a mining company when the first partner knew, which the seller did not, that the company was about to strike a rich new lode. In a case of double-dealing that enraged Peterson when it came to light, a high-ranking partner, James Glanville, urged one of his clients to make a hostile bid for a company that other Lehman partners were advising on how to defend against hostile bids. The warfare was over the top even by Wall Street’s dog-eat-dog standards.

It worked like this: Suppose a conglomerate with $100 million of earnings per year traded at forty times earnings, so its outstanding stock was worth $4 billion. Smaller, less glamorous businesses usually traded at far lower multiples. The conglomerate could use its highly valued shares to buy a company with, say, $50 million of earnings that was valued at just twenty times earnings. The conglomerate would issue $1 billion of new stock ($50 million of earnings × 20) to pay the target’s shareholders. That would lift earnings by 50 percent but enlarge the conglomerate’s stock base by just 25 percent ($4 billion + $1 billion), so that its earnings per share increased by 20 percent.

As KKR, Forstmann Little, and other buyout firms chalked up big profits on their investments of the late 1970s and early 1980s, insurance companies and other institutions began to divert a bit of the money they had invested in public stocks and bonds to the new LBO funds. By diversifying their mix of assets to include buyouts and real estate, these investors reduced risk and could boost their overall returns over time. The money they moved into the buyout funds was used to buy the stock, or equity, of companies.

Almost immediately, as it became clear that the United States would lead a war to drive back Saddam Hussein’s army, oil prices shot up and hotel bookings plummeted as people were daunted by the costs and risks of travel. “Our reservation volume fell off a cliff,” Silverman says. “It was down 30 to 40 percent in one day.”

Flustered, Stockman stared at Lipson’s spreadsheet and retorted, “Well, that’s just because of the way you structured it.” “Exactly!” said Lipson. Silverman, Altman, and Lipson won the argument, and in the coming months the investment played out exactly as they’d hoped. In December 1992, a year after the $760 million buyout, Time Warner exercised its option to buy out Blackstone’s stake in the resurgent company for $104 million. Stockman’s dyspeptic prophesy notwithstanding, Blackstone raked in a 27 percent return.

“These were all medium-sized, cyclical businesses that we bought within two or three years of an economic top,” says Schwarzman. “We paid too much for some of them. We had ambitious turnaround plans for them that turned out to be very difficult to execute.” The losses taught the firm several lessons, he says. First, “don’t pay too much when you’re buying cyclicals,” he says. Second, “don’t have ambitious turnaround expectations for medium-sized companies. Don’t expect to reinvent them.” Third, if an investment calls for reengineering operations, “don’t have it be a Blackstone-manufactured plan.” Rather, develop a plan in consultation with seasoned executives and consultants knowledgeable enough to judge if the plan will fly.

Gallogly was the odd one out among the larger-than-life personalities and egos there. He generated none of the electricity that the brilliant and overbearing David Stockman did. He had a penchant for analysis, but he was not an eccentric mad-scientist number-grinder like James Mossman. Nor could he compete for laughs with the outgoing, wisecracking Howie Lipson. Gallogly, who began his career on the lending side at Manufacturers Hanover bank, was intense, reserved, and soft-spoken. Innately cautious, he retained a loan officer’s fear of risk, measuring his words and agonizing over investments.

Competing with the VCs wasn’t really an option, though. That took in-depth knowledge of tech industries ranging from semiconductors and software to websites and biotechs—sectors where private equity firms had little if any expertise and few contacts. Moreover, entrepreneurs flocked to the venture firms that had backed the most successful investments. Why would they come to Blackstone, which had no track record and was on the wrong coast? Buyout firms that tried to intrude on the Californian finance turf were likely to get only companies that had been rejected by the top VCs. KKR formed a joint venture with the venture firm Accel, and Carlyle launched venture funds, but they never left a big mark.

The book dealt only with a limited subject: the negative environmental effects of excessive pesticide use. But the perspective taken by the author shook Ye to the core. The use of pesticides had seemed to Ye just a normal, proper—or, at least, neutral—act, but Carson’s book allowed Ye to see that, from Nature’s perspective, their use was indistinguishable from the Cultural Revolution, and equally destructive to our world. If this was so, then how many other acts of humankind that had seemed normal or even righteous were, in reality, evil? As she continued to mull over these thoughts, a deduction made her shudder: Is it possible that the relationship between humanity and evil is similar to the relationship between the ocean and an iceberg floating on its surface? Both the ocean and the iceberg are made of the same material. That the iceberg seems separate is only because it is in a different form. In reality, it is but a part of the vast ocean.…

The explosive development of technology was analogous to the growth of cancer cells, and the results would be identical: the exhaustion of all sources of nourishment, the destruction of organs, and the final death of the host body. He advocated abolishing crude technologies such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy and keeping gentler technologies such as solar power and small-scale hydroelectric power.

“There’s nothing wrong, of course. Existence is the premise for everything else. But, Princeps, please examine our lives: Everything is devoted to survival. To permit the survival of the civilization as a whole, there is almost no respect for the individual. Someone who can no longer work is put to death. Trisolaran society exists under a state of extreme authoritarianism. The law has only two outcomes: The guilty are put to death, and the not guilty are released. For me, the most intolerable aspects are the spiritual monotony and desiccation. Anything that can lead to spiritual weakness is declared evil. We have no literature, no art, no pursuit of beauty and enjoyment. We cannot even speak of love.… Princeps, is there meaning to such a life?”

Every family has bug spray, every desk has a flyswatter under it … this long war has been going on for the entire history of human civilization. But the outcome is still in doubt. The bugs have not been eliminated. They still proudly live between the heavens and the earth, and their numbers have not diminished from the time before the appearance of the humans.
