But at some point, a prediction machine may become so accurate and reliable that it changes how an organization does things. Some AIs will affect the economics of a business so dramatically that they will no longer be used to simply enhance productivity in executing against the strategy; they will change the strategy itself.

Being precisely perfect on average can mean being actually wrong each time. Regression can keep missing several feet to the left or several feet to the right. Even if it averages out to the correct answer, regression can mean never actually hitting the target.

The failure was not due to insufficient data, but instead how analysts used that data to form a prediction. Ratings agencies based their prediction on multiple regression–like models that assumed house prices in different markets were not correlated with one another. That turned out to be false, not just in 2007 but also previously. Include the possibility that a shock might hit many housing markets simultaneously, and the probability goes way up that you lose out on CDOs, even if they are distributed across many US cities. Analysts built their regression models on hypotheses of what they believed mattered and how—beliefs unnecessary for machine learning. Machine learning models are particularly good at determining which of many possible variables will work best and recognizing that some things don’t matter and others, perhaps surprisingly, do. Now, an analyst’s intuition and hypotheses are less important. In this way, machine learning enables predictions based on unanticipated correlations, including that housing prices in Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Miami might move together.

But the potential power of such products comes from combining this rich data with a prediction machine. Both academic and industry researchers have shown that smartphones can predict irregular heart rhythms (medically, atrial fibrillation).2 So, with their prediction machines, the products that Cardiogram, AliveCor, Cardiio, and others are building use heart rate data to help diagnose heart disease. The general approach is to use heart rate data to predict the unknown information of whether a particular user has an abnormal heart rhythm. This input data is necessary to operate the prediction machine. Because prediction machines cannot run without input data, we often label it simply “data,” in contrast to training and feedback data. The uninitiated consumer cannot see the link between heart rate data and an abnormal heart rhythm from raw data. In contrast, Cardiogram can detect an irregular heart rhythm with 97 percent accuracy using its deep neural network.3 Such abnormalities cause about a quarter of strokes. With better prediction, doctors can deliver better treatment. Certain drugs can prevent strokes. For this to work, individual consumers have to provide their heart rate data. Without personal data, a machine cannot predict the risk for that particular person. The combination of a prediction machine with an individual’s personal data enables a prediction for that person’s likelihood of an irregular heart rhythm.

However, acquiring training data can be challenging. To predict the same group of items (in this case, heart patients), you need information on the outcome of interest (irregular heart rhythms) as well as information on something that will be useful for predicting that outcome in a new context (cardio-monitoring).

In order to make a good prediction, the machine must have enough individuals (or units of analysis) in the training data. The number of individuals required depends on two factors: first, how reliable the “signal” is relative to the “noise,” and second, how accurate the prediction must be to be useful. In other words, the number of required people depends on whether we expect heart rates to be a strong or a weak predictor of irregular heart rhythms and how costly a mistake will be. If heart rate is a strong predictor and mistakes are not a big deal, then we only need a few people. If heart rate is a weak predictor or if each mistake puts lives at risk, then we need thousands or even millions. Cardiogram, in its preliminary study, used six thousand people, including just two hundred with an irregular heart rhythm. Over time, one way to collect further data is through feedback on whether the app’s users have or develop irregular heart rhythms.

So, while the data technically has decreasing returns to scale—the billionth search is less useful for improving the search engine than the first—from a business viewpoint, data might be most valuable if you have more and better data than your competitor. Some have argued that more data about unique factors brings disproportionate rewards in the market.6 Increasing data brings disproportionate rewards in the market. Thus, from an economic point of view, in such cases data may have increasing returns to scale.

The answer—demonstrated over many experiments by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky—is decidedly yes.2 When they told people to consider two hospitals—one with forty-five births per day and another with fifteen births per day—and asked which hospital would have more days when 60 percent or more of the babies born are boys, very few gave the correct answer—the smaller hospital. The smaller hospital is correct because the larger the number of events (in this case, births), the likelier each daily outcome will be close to the average (in this case, 50 percent). To see how this works, imagine you are flipping coins. You are more likely to get heads every time if you flip five coins than if you flip fifty coins. Thus, the smaller hospital—precisely because it has fewer births—is more likely to have more extreme outcomes away from the average.

As we describe above, in the case of known unknowns, humans understand the inaccuracy of the prediction. The prediction comes with a confidence range that reveals its imprecision. In the case of unknown unknowns, humans don’t think they have any answers. In contrast, with unknown knowns, prediction machines appear to provide a very precise answer, but that answer can be very wrong.

No. To figure out if reading this book had an impact, you also need to know what would have happened if you hadn’t read this book. You don’t have that data. You need to observe what economists and statisticians call the “counterfactual”: what would have happened if you took a different action. Determining whether an action causes an outcome requires two predictions: first, what outcome will happen after the action is taken, and second, what outcome would have happened had a different action been taken. But that’s impossible. You will never have data on the action not taken.16

Prediction machines scale. The unit cost per prediction falls as the frequency increases. Human prediction does not scale the same way. However, humans have cognitive models of how the world works and thus can make predictions based on small amounts of data.
